# TimeKeeper

Create a class named ‘TimeKeeper.java’. The fields details for this class are as follows:
- hour
- minute
- Second

Assign the values for these fields manually by taking input from the user. Use a 24-hour clock, so that at 02:00 p.m, the value of the hour field is actually 14 and not simply 2.

Create the following methods: 

1-  A method to calculate the number of seconds that have passed since midnight up to the time input by the user.

2-  A method to display the percentage of the day that has passed. Use floating-point values for this method or you will have to  face problems while calculating percentages with integer values.
